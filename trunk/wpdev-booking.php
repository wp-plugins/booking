 * starting day of the reservation is the same (for examplemonday) in dynamic range selection and also the rent time (customers can still rent a house for 3 days for instance)..
 * Different rental lengths for different types of items. For example, Room 1 is only available to rent 1 day at a time and Room 2 is available to rent for either 1, 3 or 7 days… Also, allowing for different forms for different types of items would be great
